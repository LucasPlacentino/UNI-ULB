transport phenomena  

>slide 42:  

diffusion and radiation, for heat (not for matter etc)  

convection: transfer associated to bulk fluid motion  
a fluid through a pipe carries mechanical (kinetic) energy, thermal energy, internal energy(chemical and thermal)  

diffusion: transfer asssociated to tthe particle random walk  

temperature gradient  


>slide43:  

### Convective Flux (of momentum, energy, mass)  
total flux: amount of a quantity passing through a unit _surface area_ per unit of _time_  

$Flux_A = (Quantity "A")/(S*\Delta(t))$  

fluid flow in a tube with a _uniform velocity_ v  

- Mass: M_c = $\rho*v*S*\Delta(t)$  
    $J_Mc = (M_c)/(S*\Delta(t) = \rho*v^2$  
- Momentum: $Q_c = \rho*v^2*S*\Delta(t)$  
    $J_Qc = Q_c/(S\Delta(t)........$  
- Energy: $E_c = ro c_v v (T-T_0) S Delta(t)$  
    $J_Ec = ........$  

when temp increases, density decreases
so buoyancy, it goes up, that body of air heats up  
=> convection happens


>slide 44:  

### Diffusive Flux (of momentum)  
two parallel fluid "layers":  
two fluids in a single tube flowing in the same direction parallely  
with $v_a > v_b$  
has an external force that keeps pushing the fluid  
(laminar flow)  

shear stress (between the two fluids) => momentum transfer  
no transfer of mass  
the higher the shear stress, the higher the momentum transfer  

friction force determines the $J_Q$ in the direction transversal to the flow  
shear stress ($\tau$) is proportional to the velocity gradient ($du/dx$)  
when shear stress increases, the rate of deformation increases  

equations: **see slide (44)**  
_Newton's law (of viscosity)_  
fluids that follow this law are Newtonian fluids  
(units: **see slide (44)**)  
$\mu$ : dynamic viscosity, _intrinsic resistance_ of the fluid to motion  

see plot of different fluids **slide 44**  

more viscosity means more drag for objects moving through the fluid  


> slide 45  
### Planar Couette flow
fluid layer b/w two very large parallel plates (distance $l$)  
constant parallel _force F_ (drag force)  
no slip condition at walls:  
$u(0)=0$ and $u(l)=0$  
**see slide (45)** for velocity profile  
laminar flow, hence $u=f(y)$ => no mixing  

drag force is imposed: $\tau = F/A = \mu*du/(dy) = c$  
velocity profile is linear: $u(y) = V*y/l$  


>slide 46
### Fluid rheology (study of fluids)  
**SEE SLIDE 46**
- Qualitative behavior  
- Equation  
- Fluids  


>slide 47
### Constitutive relations - 1
- Momentum diffusion flux (Newton's law)  
    **see slide**  
- Energy diffusive flux (Fourier's law)  
    **see slide**  
- Mass diffusion flux (Fick's law)  
    **see slide**  
these equations have different units even tho they have the same principle  
momentum.......  


>slide 48
### Summary of Transport Processes
**SEE SLIDE 48**  
table with:  
cause, effect, transport property, law  


>slide 49
### Mean free path, $\lambda$  
refers to the average distance that a moving particle travels b/w successive collisions or impacts  
equation: **see slide (49)**  


>slide 50
### Gas viscosity (interpretation based on kinetic theory)  
molecules have a random velocity in the y direction, due to thermal motion  
$v = \sqrt (3k_bT/m)$  

diffusion flux, taylor expansion of the flux, constitutive equation  
=> final expression of viscosity: **see slide (50)**  


>slide 51
### Viscosity variation with temperature  
graph (viscosity of liquids or gases from temp): **see slide (51)**  
- Liquids: higher energy at high temps oppose the large cohesive.....  
- Gases: ........  


>slide 52
### Viscosity measurements  
Viscometers  
**SEE SLIDE (52)**  
_torque_ measurement of the inner shaft in a fluid filled tube at a given _angular velocity_  
(torque= force times radius of the inner cylinder here)  
(face area = circomference times length of the tube, so like an opened (length direction cut) tube put flat)  


>slide 53
### Thermal conductivity (interpretation based on kinetic energy)  
.....  
=> final expression of thermal conductivity: .....  


>slide 54
### Mass diffusivity (interpretation based on kinetic energy)  
.....  
=> final expression of mass diffusovity: .....  


>slide 55
### Relation b/w the diffusion coefficients  
basically just the above equations on the other  
**see slide (55)**  
$\alpha/\nu$  
$D/\nu$
