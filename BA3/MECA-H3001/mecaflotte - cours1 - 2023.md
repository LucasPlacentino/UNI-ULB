## Thermodynamics and evolution

### Transport processes

**Flux** of: **mass, momentum, energy** (like electric charge)  

- a **cause**: the **driving force**
- an **effet**: the **flux**

At **equilibrium**, heat will stop flowing  
The heat flux will remain stationary  

A state of un-equilibrium can only be maintained through the introduction of energy into the system  

Thermodynamics is about the **initial** and **final states** of a system  
The **evolution** of systems if the subject of **transport phenomena**  

Many systems are far from equilibrium  
**Thermodynamic variables** (temp, pressure, ...) can be defined **locally**, even in non-equilibrium  

#### Admissible degreee of non-equilibrium

> _slide 30_  

System split into elementary volumes ofl inear dimension $\lambda$ (volume $\lambda^3$)

> $\bar{A}$ or $<A>$ mean average of $A$, we will mostly use the first (overbar)  

**Macroscopic gradient** of A -> **Fluctuations** of A  

Local equilibrium when:
- fluctuations of A are small, **$\delta A/\bar{A}$<<1**
- the variation of A due to the macroscopic gradient $\nabla A$ is smaller than the fluctuations $\delta A$, **$\nabla A$<<$\delta A$**

> _slide 31_  

Gaseous system: define temp within 0.1% accuracy  
N avout $10^6$ particles

Admissible gradient to fall in the local equilibrium ?  

> **input equation**

$\lambda$ about 0.1 Âµm  
Maximum gradient: a million ($10^6$) K/m  

#### applicability condition(s)

> expected value = average
